# IM-IWAE
'IM-IWAE.py' implements IM-IWAE, the deep generative model for MNAR data under the condition of no self-censoring given latent variables.   

To run the synthetic experiments, execute the code in 'sim3d.py' and 'mixgaussian.py' in the folder 'simulation' for the 3-dimensional simulation and mixture of Guassian simulation.

To run the real-world experiments, execute the code in 'uci_mnar.py', 'binary3d.py' and 'music_ratings.py' in the folder of 'real data analysis', which correspond to the experiments on UCI data, HIV data and Yahoo! R3 music ratings. Downloading of the corresponding datasets online is needed.
